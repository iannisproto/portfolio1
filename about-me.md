Hi! I'm Iannis! I'm sixteen and have been playing the violin since I was ten. That might sound late for most people but it's been an amazing journey for me. At first when I started out playing the violin, I wasn't really into it. It was much more like something I was doing something rather than loving. But then I changed once I turned fourteen. I became serious about my playing this instrument and began seeing it as something more than just a school activity.

Most of what I learned on the violin was at school. I had weekly lessons with my teacher but unlike most other musicians, there wasn't an organized grading system or regular examinations to actually measure my development. Therefore, it has been more of a isolated journey with most of my sessions being one-on-one with my violin teacher. However, this was not enough reason to give up on it and now, I make sure that I practice carefully.

During summer, I go to orchestra camps because they allow me to play alongside other musicians. My school orchestra is another music group I belong to although we don't perform often. Still, it feels good to belong somewhere partaking in creating music together.

Other school music events are also times when I get involved and can play with other musicians, but other than that I unfortunately only play alone at my house. Music is something that I’m passionate about when it comes to listening and less about dedicating my life to it, but I can’t wait to see how far I can go with the violin.
