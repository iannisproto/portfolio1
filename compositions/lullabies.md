		<h3>Composing First Lullaby</h3>
		<p>For the first lullaby out of four, I worked really hard to find a melody I liked. I tried over and over again, experimenting with different ideas. My goal was to use simple leaps and scales to keep the melody easy and pleasant. After many attempts, I finally created a melody that I really loved. I wanted it to end on a C note, but when I couldn’t make that happen, I decided to go with F major instead. Even though it wasn’t what I originally planned, I think it turned out beautifully. This lullaby ended up being my favorite of all the ones I wrote.</p>

		<h3>Composing Second Lullaby</h3>
		<p>For my second lullaby I tried recreating the process for the first one, but it ended up taking a lot of time. Nevertheless, I still managed to make a melody I liked, but I worry the form mimics the first one too much.</p>

		<h3>Composing Third Lullaby</h3>
		<p>For my third lullaby, I tried to change things up a bit. I wanted a soft, smooth melody, but it didn’t turn out how I thought it would. Instead of being simple, the melody became a bit harsh and different. Even though it’s not what I planned, I like how it turned out.</p>

		<h3>Composing Fourth Lullaby</h3>
		<p>For the final lullaby, I changed my approach again. I wanted to create a slower and softer melody this time. I hoped it would feel more calming and gentle.</p>
