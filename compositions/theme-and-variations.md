        <p>I chose to use my first lullaby as the theme.</p>

        <p>For the first variation, I decided to incorporate triplets into the melody, to create a quick and brisk feel.</p>

		<h3 style="margin-bottom: 0px;">Second Variation</h3>
        <audio controls style="width: 100%;">

        <p>I decide to use eight notes and quarter notes while stile keeping the same impression as in the theme.</p>

        <audio controls style="width: 100%;">

        <p>I aimed at creating a sad variation. I decided to try using a 3/4 time signature and did my best to make it somber.</p>
		<h3 style="margin-bottom: 0px;">Fourth Variation</h3>
        <audio controls style="width: 100%;">

        <p>I wanted to make this the most wild and difficult, to really have fun with it. This one took the longest time to make, as I was searching for sections that fit together to make it feel rampant. In the end I rethought a lot of the pieces in it, and restructured it too.</p>
