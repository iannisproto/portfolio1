<p>This music portfolio represents me and my journey as a growing musician. It captures the lessons learned along the way and includes personal statements, logs, and reviews depicting my learning process and giving ideas about my next steps in skill improvement. I've include several performances and compositions from Year 6 and Year 7 for clear picture of my progress over time and how my style of expression has changed.</p>
<p>This is a collection of recordings, notes, and comments that document my development and fun experiences throughout my music journey. Each piece serves not only to demonstrate skills but also to show creative ways I connected with the music through improvisation, collaboration, or genre exploration.</p>
<p>I have certainly enjoyed experimenting with new ideas and techniques, and this portfolio is testimony to how much I love music and am committed to growth. The process of documenting my progress has been rewarding, but I also look forward with excitement to sharing this journey with you.</p>
