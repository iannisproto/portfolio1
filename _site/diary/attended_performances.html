<p class="credit">Performed by Solistes Européens Luxembourg in Philarmonie Luxembourg, pianist Jan Lisiecki and conducted by Christoph König</p>
<hr />
<p>I had a great time going to this concert. It started off with Rossini's overture, a charming prelude which I absolutely love and went on to the Temporale. The intensity and passion of the orchestra was stunning. I think the opera as a whole is extremely catchy and memorable. I particularly enjoyed the wide variety of orchestral instruments which all contribute to make it sound very layered and well made. It’s also very familiar to me, because its so popular and iconic.</p>
<p>However, the focus of the performance was Mozart's Piano Concerto No. 20. I really enjoyed this as well. The absolute highlight of the concert was seeing the pianist Jan Lisiecki’s captivating performance. Since I was positioned in the third row, I could clearly see Lisiecki's dramatic and physical aspect of his performance. I could see him sweating wildly as his fingers surged over the piano, which absolutely highlighted the emotional experience of Mozart’s piano concerto.</p>
<p>Concluding the evening was Beethoven's "Pastoral" Symphony. Prior to the concert I had read about how Beethoven enjoyed depicting nature's landscapes as he spent a great deal of his time with walks, which really helped the expression of his symphony for me.</p>

    <li><i>La clemenza di Tito K. 621</i> by <b>Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart</b></li>
</ul>

<p class="credit">Directed by Fabio Biondi in the Grand Theatre of the City of Luxembourg</p>
<hr />
<p>My excitement was high because it is a classic Mozart opera, and my dad hyped up the conductor Fabio Biondi as a master. But to be completely honest my personal experience was not as enjoyable as I hoped.</p>
<p>The music was good, I have no complaints, but the scenery did not really go well with my taste. Turns out that the musical group had taken an extremely modern approach to the opera. For example, with dressing Emperor Tito in shorts, flip flops, and a touristy shirt. I got a feeling of the experience to be very unusual, especially when during the performance, they threw in current activist messages, scenes of terrorism, and loud gunshots. It made me think that the performance was not particularly focused on the actual opera. </p>
<p>Towards the end, they even changed course from the opera to go on about their personal stories. The singers and actors started sharing their own stories of activism and how opera helped them find trust in humanity again. I honestly was very confused at this point, so I did not really understand everything they said. However, each one introduced themselves, shared anecdotes, and talked about how life brought them to stand on that scene. In the end it felt like they took an overly big liberty with the expressive freedom.</p>
<p>During this performance I was sitting next to a woman, a violinist from America, who I small talked with. She enjoyed the music but also disappointed with the changes. She even left early because she was tired of the confusing turn of events.</p>
<p>I had read up on the opera beforehand, knew the story well, and even quizzed the people I went with. It is about Emperor Tito's reign in ancient Rome where his friend Sesto falls in love with Vitellia who forms a conspiracy against Tito. Vitellia manipulates Sesto into joining the plot to assassinate the emperor. The opera leaps into chaos when Sesto is torn between his loyalty to Tito and his feelings for Vitellia.</p>
<p>When in the end the assassination attempt fails, Tito finds out about the betrayal. But instead of revenge, Tito surprises everyone by choosing forgiveness, showing mercy.</p>
<p>But despite knowing the plot, the modern twist left me questioning the meaning of the plot. Especially as they turned around the composition a bit, essentially starting with the end and ending with the beginning.</p>

    <li><i>Swan Lake Op. 20</i> by <b>Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky</b></li>
</ul>

<p class="credit">Performed in TRIFOLION Echternach</p>
<hr />
<p>Tonight’s performance was very eventful. I haven’t seen many ballets before, so I wasn’t sure what to expect. But I still held great excitement due to how famous Swan Lake is, how much I’ve heard about it, how much I’ve listened to it myself, and for being one of the first compositions I performed in a recital (even though it was during my beginner years).</p>
<p>Overall, the ballet felt incredibly colourful, energetic and lively, which I really enjoyed. However, I was a bit disappointed because there wasn’t actually a live orchestra, and I didn’t realise it until I had gotten there. I had to make do with a recording from speakers from the ceiling. The music was still great, but the main reason I go to these sorts of performances is because I can listen to however much Tchaikovsky I want at home and going to a room where I can personally witness a real orchestra is something I find very captivating. There’s just something about the vibrations in the air.</p>
<p>Still, the performance was good. I felt as if the dancers were extremely skilled. They moved so comfortably and with so much confidence it looked like they knew exactly what they were doing. One thing I noticed and particularly enjoyed was how animated the performers were. Their body language was just so clear, and it really helped in understanding what was happening on scene. For example, someone in the background of what I think was Prince Siegfried’s court, a nobleman, asked someone for a dance by getting on one knee and very visibly showing they were inviting them out to the ballroom.</p>

</ul>

<p class="credit">Performed by Brentano Quartet in Philarmonie Luxembourg</p>
<hr />
<p>Went to see the Brentano Quartet at Philarmonie Luxembourg, and to be honest I do not really know how to feel.</p>
<p>I walked in expecting a classical setting for the evening, but it was more on the modern side than I thought. It started off with Haydn, and getting lost in it was wonderful. I particularly remember that the first violin was easy to focus on in a way that I could just zoom out and clearly focus on its voice. And the quartet looked really happy, and they were very expressive and moving around a lot. Surprisingly, it was twenty whole minutes. It felt more like twenty seconds.</p>
<p>Then, things took a turn with James McMillan's compositions. Modern, a bit weird, and very solemn – felt like I was floating away. But each piece lasted only about four minutes, even though it felt like forty. I was expecting something more classical, but it was clear to me that it would be modern performances, especially with "For Sonny," where for the entirety of the piece the first violin was plucking a simple melody while being accompanied with what was described as “long, clashing, grief-struck chords”.</p>
<p>Closing with Beethoven was powerful. I felt as if there were complex and dense melodies all over the place. It did not feel very classical, and I later learned it may have been because it was composed later in Beethoven's career when he was experimenting more. Beethoven's quartet played very dense textures, complex melodies, and extreme volumes. I also found out that that specific composition was sent into space in 1977 on a record to represent Earth's sound!</p>
<p>It also turns out that grief was a common thread in each performance. Beethoven’s composition was during his pain and illness and MacMillan was processing grief through tributes to loved ones. The mix of classical and modern, the emotions, and the shared theme of grief made an overall good musical experience.</p>

</ul>

<p class="credit">Performed by il Pomo d’Oro Choir and Joyce DiDonato in Philarmonie Luxembourg</p>
<hr />
<p>Seeing Dido and Æneas was an incredible musical experience. I got to see the great Joyce DiDonato, a legend among mezzo-sopranos. Even though I did not know much about her before, I am thoroughly impressed by her talent now.</p>
<p>During this great performance, I was seated very high up on a balcony, which was a new experience for me. Usually, I prefer being as close to the stage as possible, but all the other seats were either sold out or for double the price I got for the balcony seat. Despite not having the best view, I was able to enjoy the performance with no problems at all.</p>
<p>One strange thing I noticed was a big black box-like instrument that someone was playing throughout the performance, appearing as if it was played like a keyboard. Neither I nor my friend I was with knew what it was. I also know for sure it wasn’t the harpsichord because there already was one right in front of it.</p>
<p>UPDATE: The 29th of February I learned in music class that it’s a continuo organ.</p>
<p>It felt unusual to watch an opera in English and with English subtitles, but it allowed for a new perspective because it made it easier to follow along.</p>
<p>There was one specific moment that I vividly remember because it impressed me a lot. The actor who played a character pretending to be the roman god Mercury had a magnificent and rich voice that I captivated me and my friend.</p>
<p>However, the highlight of the entire event was definitely scene two of the last act, act three. It was emotionally moving and absolutely beautiful. The aria “Dido’s Lament” and the recitative “Thy hand, Belinda” were particularly touching. I was also shocked to realise that I already knew “Thy hand, Belinda	“ because I had heard it before and liked it so much that I had saved it on my phone. I just didn’t know it was from this opera. And hearing it sung by Joyce DiDonato definitely immortalised it for me.</p>

    <li><i>Orfeo ed Euridice</i> by <b>Christoph Willibald Gluck</b></li>
</ul>

<p class="credit">A Opéra Comique production in the Grand Theatre of the City of Luxembourg</p>
<hr />
<p>I really enjoyed this performance. I was already excited beforehand because the legend of Orpheus and Eurydice is something I know well and have been familiar with for a while. I even partook in a play about it a few years ago in my religion class.</p>
<p>The music was beautiful, and there were even some parts I recognised. For example, “Che farò senza Euridice”, which I’ve heard and liked before. And from the start of the performance, I was immediately captivated by the visual aspects. The stage felt dramatic and so alive it definitively made this an unforgettable experience.</p>
<p>I also found the scenery really impressive. It was fascinating how it was so technical and would keep moving, sinking and rotating platforms to really fit in with the story. There was also this huge mobile wall of glass/mirrors that was moving around, contributing to creating an atmosphere for each scene. Something I specifically found really impressive was how at one point they created a sort of abstract cloud during the climax of the opera with just veiling fabrics held by two people.</p>
<p>I felt like the dancers were extremely skilled, too. There was a small group of them that were especially enchanting. I later found out they were actually circus artists, which made sense to me considering their controlled agility and graceful movements. And it wasn’t just dancers contributing to making the performance feeling very moving and alive, even the lead singers like the woman who played Eros was climbing, falling and spinning.</p>
<p>I also loved the contribution of the choir to the atmosphere. They weren’t all on the scene, but the ones who were moving as one artistic and abstract unit which really fascinated me. However, I did find it a bit confusing that the two most important roles, the ones of Orpheus and Eurydice, were both played by very similarly dressed women.</p>
<p>Despite that, there were moments I liked, where the music completely took over. It would either be the orchestra or just a solo flute playing for a few moments which allowed me to relax, close my eyes and get lost in the music.</p>
<p>Overall, it was an amazing experience, and I would absolutely see it again.</p>

<p class="credit">Performed by Orchestre du Chambre du Luxembourg and Sequenda Opera Studio in CAPE – Centre des Arts Pluriels Ettelbruck.</p>
<hr />
<p>So, tonight I went to see Don Pasquale and I have to say that my feelings are a bit mixed.</p>
<p>I found the event very cozy and nice. It was a small orchestra, just 11 musicians. I did love the very comfortable setting. However, as I had chosen a seat in the front, I was very close to the timpani which played very loudly. That along with the trumpet, felt like the only thing I heard as it almost drowned out anything else.<p>
<p>I also particularly remember the conductor. She was young and fully of energy, she conducted with a very theatrical enthusiasm. The theatrical aspect of the entire opera felt very off on its own. I had a difficult time losing myself in the music. What surprised me the most about the conductor was that she seemed to know every piece of lyric by heart. She would mouth along, even to the very quick fast-paced parts towards the end.</p>
<p>All in all, I hate to say it, but the concert left me feeling a bit underwhelmed. It was just... meh. Maybe it was the seating, or perhaps my expectations were too high, but it didn't quite hit the spot for me.</p>

</ul>

<p class="credit">Directed by Petr Polka and performed by Luxembourg Philharmonic and soloist Leonidas Kavakos.</p>
<hr />
<p>This performance is one that I will absolutely never forget.</p>
<p>As soon as I heard Kavakos start with Bartók’s 2nd violin concerto, I was captivated. I couldn’t get the feeling of it being explosive out of my mind as it was hectically performed in front of me. The entire experience felt breathtakingly wild. The intensity of the concerto, mixed with the beauty of it all made for a great musical experience. Kavakos’s technique was impressive beyond comprehension. It sounded so much more beautiful than I’d expected. I found myself wishing the performance would never end, willing to give up anything just to hear Kavakos play a little longer, because the moment felt so special.</p>
<p>I was extremely lucky to find a seat at the third row, perfectly centred to Kavakos himself. This meant he was barely three meters away from me during the entire performance of the violin concerto. I had heard of this living legend many times and watched videos of his technical prowess but seeing him in person felt magical. Watching him walk onto the stage, I knew the experience would be unreal, and he did not disappoint. At one point I remember a cellist accidentally plucking a string during the pause between the second and third movement. Kavakos just looked over and smiled very friendly. It was a small but memorable moment, as it really shows how friendly and casual Kavakos really is.</p>
<p>Strauss’s An Alpine Symphony was also very nice. It was beautiful and delightful. I remember it giving me chills during one of the climaxes. The melodies were magical, making you feel like you’re losing yourself and then finding home. It was extremely powerful and felt very grand.</p>
<p>Despite never having heard either of the performances before, except for listening to the violin concerto on repeat the day before, I know for sure that I will listen to it many times in the future. The violin concerto was so mesmerising, I just want nothing else other than to learn it better, to understand it. And even now, the day after, the more I listen to it the more I feel like I get the bigger picture of it.</p>

    <li><i>Les Contes D’Hoffman</i> by <b>Jacques Offenbach</b></li>
</ul>

<p class="credit">Conducted by Marco Armalito and performed by Benjamin Bernheim Erin Morley, Pretty Yende, Clementine Margaine and Vasilisa Berzhanskaya at the Metropolitan Opera</p>
<hr />
<p>I was thoroughly entertained with the staging of "Les Contes D'Hoffmann" acted out by the Metropolitan Opera in New York but streamed over to places such as Luxembourg in cinemas. This was my not my first experience with opera, but I was worried the length of the performance would be a lot for me. It was further made more comfortable for me with seating arrangements and a darkened atmosphere which was more comfortable than an actual concert hall.</p>
<p>The experience was excellent, but I had a feeling that the sound was somewhat plastic. Anyway, this streaming format had great zooms and changes of the camera position, which allowed me to see the performers and the set better. That again made this experience more interesting and helped me understand the opera better.</p>
<p>I also think seeing such a grand execution of an opera changed how I see opera. I mean, before that, I did not understand as well why people are completely in love with opera. Now I can see beauty and emotion in it. I must say the storyline was slightly confusing as there were so many characters involved and different plot-lines entwined, but as the whole play went on, I just caught into it and started liking it a lot.</p>
<p>Some of my favourite parts included famous songs such as "Les Oiseaux dans la charmille" and "Belle nuit, ô nuit d'amour." These tunes were so pretty and touching. I'm surprised how many new tunes I enjoyed linger in my head, and since the show, I still hum them.</p>
<p>I loved the second act because the music was enchanting and sweet. By contrast, the third act did not impress me that much. It all seemed kind of weird since it took place at an escort service, and it was absolutely far from the pretty scenes in the earlier acts.</p>
<p>The conclusion was that it was an enlightening and entertaining experience when I first watched "Les Contes D'Hoffmann". Though there were a number of drawbacks concerning the sound and the setting of the third act, I thoroughly enjoyed the show. I left the cinema knowing I would be back if another performance would stream again. The nice music combined with the storytelling made this experience memorable for me.</p>

<p>This was a small event with numerous student players and bands, including one classical duo touring in Sweden, known as Duojag. I was impressed by the players; for students, their level of ability and artistry was quite good. It was fun to see the dynamics of emphasis and emotion they brought with their playing, and I felt that they played the dynamics very nicely.</p>
<p>However, there were slight challenges regarding the performance: sometimes they didn't quite play in sync, and because of the echo in the room, at times the piano sound was muffled. Also, people strolled in from the streets at moments, which added to the background noise. Besides these minute distractions, it was a pleasure.</p>

<p>The performance I saw tonight was absolutely incredible. When I bought the tickets, I was really excited to see Hilary Hahn play Tchaikovsky's Violin Concerto, which I think is one of the most impressive and grand violin concertos out there. I couldn't believe I was going to see her perform it live! But unfortunately, due to a double pinched nerve she suffered earlier this year, she wasn't cleared to perform. So, I arrived at the concert feeling a bit disappointed. On the bright side, I got to see Mikko Franck conduct, someone I recognized from my second favourite recording of the Sibelius Violin Concerto with Hilary Hahn. But honestly, that didn't even matter once Sol Gabetta took the stage – her performance and energy was amazing!</p>
<p>From the start, Berlioz's overture had me surprised by how good it sounded. Mikko was such a dynamic conductor, and it was funny watching him exchange funny glances with Sol and the other musicians. You could tell they were having a great time.</p>
<p>Then Sol Gabetta took the stage, and wow! I don't know Lalo's Cello Concerto very well, but she played with so much emotion that I fell in love with it instantly. Her performance felt so genuine, and every note was absolutely perfect. I enjoyed Lalo's Cello Concerto infinitely more than I had expected. I also loved Franck’s playful vibe, especially when he did a playful dance move during the second movement.</p>
<p>When we got to Franck's Symphonie in D Minor, I thought the horns were particularly powerful.</p>

<hr />
<p>An absolutely spectacular performance. The players surprised me with their technical precision and emotion, together the sound was really warm and full of emotion. Its one of the few moments when I've seen players look so happy playing together, constantly looking at each other and exchanging smiles and jokes. Particularly during a moment where Yo-Yo Mas string broke and he had to run backstage to change it. The music was also surprisingly great. It had nice melodies and very witty music rich of love, it felt very powerful. It was an absolute dream come true, seeing these world class musicians play barely 4 meters away from me, particularly Yo-Yo Ma. For some reason, his playing was exactly as Id imagine it'd be. I recognized the vibrato, the posture and the way he was sitting. One thing which surprised me was the way hed extend his arm holding the cello, as if he was projecting the sound out into the audience, as well as seeing Kavakos fingers jump across the fingerboard. It was such small precise jumps I'm surprised I haven't considered that all world class violinists do so comfortably.</p>
<p>They also played two encores, much to everyone's joy. The first one was a piece by Schubert of which I didn't catch the name and the second was the theme from the movie Schindler's list. Both were beautiful, although I particularly liked the theme from Schindler's list. It was extremely emotional and nice.<p>

<hr />
<p>I had the pleasure of attending the comic opera "Il viaggio a Reims" in Salzburg while I was there for the holidays. It turned out to be a new experience for me as I rarely get to see operas that had as good staging as this one.</p>
<p>The most impressive thing for me was the vivid acting. Singers were singing beautifully, but they moved around energetically and in intricate interaction with one another. I rarely find myself so swept up in a performance, but here everything came together so well that I was lost in the performance. However, I noticed that the orchestra felt a lot less apparent to me. I enjoyed the stage and the scenery so much I forgot to really enjoy the music.</p>
<p>The acting was superb and the singing very talented. The scenery was fun and really added a great deal to the experience. The humor was quick-witted, humorous with sprinklings of jokes throughout that ranged in topic from general humor to some satirical and political themes. I found the exploration of nationalities in the story particularly interesting with well-rounded and rich characters.</p>
<p>I am especially impressed by how well the singers stayed in character and the cozy, breathtaking opera house itself. And I liked the modern adaptation. The original story revolves around a group of travelers at an inn, all waiting to head to the coronation of the king of France. Their different nationalities clash, leading to drama and intriguing relationships. In this adaptation, the setting shifts to an airport, and mentioned themes like Brexit and leaning into various stereotypes for comedic effect.</p>
<p>One of the real highlights for me was the aria "All'ombra amena" in the third act: an otherworldly voice was singing an exquisite piece from a balcony that was directly across my seat on the balcony. Overall, I was really happy to have attended, even though the many relationships in the story sometimes made it a bit tricky to follow.</p>

<p>Since it was a ballet called "Sacre", I honestly wasn't expecting to be mesmerized in any way. Rarely do I go and watch ballets, but if I do, it is some classical performance. I couldn't understand it and just didn't feel anything; the feeling I get when I am in a concert hall, listening to an opera, wasn't there at all. That said, I welcomed the opportunity to experience such a renowned work by modern composers; therefore, it turned out to be an interesting experience overall.</p>
<p>From this performance, I learned three major things:</p>
<ol>
    <li>How powerful movement and dance can be regarding the conveyance of emotion and storytelling.</li>
    <li>How the orchestra creates this creepy environment that adds to the overall atmosphere.</li>
    <li>How such an interrelation of complicated choreography, scenery, and light effects can make a person's surroundings so thrilling and impressionable.</li>
</ol>

<hr />
<p>Going to see La Traviata, I was both excited and curious. This famous Verdi opera was a 'modern' version, with updated scenery. Since the subtitles would be in German - a language I am not familiar with - I read about the story in advance so that I would be able to understand it.</p>
<p>My experience in the performance was fair and less thrilling compared to what I had anticipated. The orchestral music was interesting, though. There were two violin solos during the later acts that really grasped my attention. Most singers were good, although others didn't impress me. The set was minimalist, with few curtains, a pile of books, and a wood chair. This felt a bit too sparse for my taste. I do think this took away from the overall impact of the story, even though the singers tried their best to show the emotions.</p>
<p>Sitting in the audience, I reflected on my journey with opera: every performance shapes and molds my perception of this art. I have made a very concerted effort to like it more, but I do still find certain aspects of it challenging. Well, only a few months ago, I was still trying to figure out what I liked about opera, and I'm slowly getting there, but this performance did not resonate with me.</p>
<p>By the end of the evening, I was really able to make it to the stage exit door and got a signature from Galina Cheplakova, who performed the role of Violetta. While that was very nice, in general, this performance left me with a feeling of incompleteness. It was enjoyable, yet not as bright as some of my previous experiences.</p>
